# Slides Formatter
This is a simple Node.js script to copy slides onto a base background PDF.    
I use it to format my professors' lecture slides so that the slides are on a gridded A4 paper and I have room for annotations.  
Feel free to use the script yourself. A basic A4 grid paper is included in this repo.

## Usage
- Clone this repo to your desired location ```git clone https://github.com/milantheiss/slidesformatter```  
- Install all dependencies
```npm install```  
- Execute the script with ```node main.js [-f if overwrite] <base-pdf-path> <slides-pdf-path> <output-pdf-path>```
